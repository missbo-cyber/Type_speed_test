## Speed Typing Test

This is a simple speed typing test program written in Python using the curses library. 
It allows users to practice their typing speed by typing a randomly chosen line of text as fast as possible.

## Features
- Generates a random line of text from a provided text file for the user to type (in my file there are some informations about different dog breeds).
- Calculates and displays the user's typing speed in words per minute assuming that one word has 5 characters.
- Supports backspacing and escape key to exit the typing test.
- Displays colored feedback for correct and incorrect keystrokes.
